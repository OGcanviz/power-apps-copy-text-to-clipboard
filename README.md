# power-apps-copy-text-to-clipboard
This component includes a textbox with a button next to it.  When you click the button it copies the contents of the textbox to the clipboard.  The current value of the text in the textbox is available as a component output property.  This allows the value in the textbox to be used directly from the Power App.
